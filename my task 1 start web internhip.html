     <h2>About My Internship</h2>
    <p>Currently, I am doing my internship at <strong>YoungDev</strong>, where I am learning practical web development skills. This basic HTML page is part of my practice, showing how to structure a webpage using HTML, CSS, and images.</p>

    <p>Through this internship, I am improving my skills in front-end development, learning how to create clean and responsive websites. Working on real-world projects at YoungDev is helping me gain hands-on experience in web technologies.</p>
